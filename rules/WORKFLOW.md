## Windows Environment Protocols

### Anti-Locking Git Operations
- **Root Context**: ALWAYS execute `git` commands from the repository root (`E:\OppRadar`). NEVER execute `git` commands while the terminal CWD is inside a subdirectory (e.g., `OppRadar/`) that might be modified/deleted by the git operation.
- **Process Cleanup**: Before `git pull`, `git rebase`, or `git checkout`, ensure no background processes (like `node` servers) are holding locks on files in `OppRadar/` or `scripts/`.
- **Interactive Prompts**: Git for Windows may prompt "Should I try again? (y/n)" if a file is locked. To avoid this hanging the agent:
  - Ensure the CWD is safe (Root).
  - If it happens, the Agent must NOT try to interact (which fails). The Agent should have prevented it by ensuring clean state.
  - **Explicit Kill**: Before major git operations that change directory structure, explicitly kill potential locking processes (e.g., `Stop-Process -Name node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`).
